# Operations Research Projects

This project contains some works about Research Operations things. There are some Linear Programming Problems (PPL) developed in Jupyter Notebooks. There are in this moment two projects in development:

- Project1: This is a work about **Lagrangean Relaxation** of a problem PPL hard to solve. We are now going to solve this in a pedagogical way (jupyter notebook), and then we are going to visualize the results and upload a **web interface (Flask / Nodejs)**.

- Project2: This is a work about **Columns Generation** of a problem with differents instances. We are going to solve this in a pedagogical way (jupyter notebook), and then we are going to visualize the results in a **GUI interface (Tkinter / Electron)**.

After these projects I'm going to propose some new Projects about one of this things:

- Introduction to PuLP in Python (Basics in Optimization / PPL)
- Simulation Problems (Discrete Event Simulation with Simpy)
- Marketing Problems (Cuantitative Marketing Models)
